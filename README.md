# BlackjackBot
A simple Discord bot which allows you to play a variation of Blackjack against an automated dealer. Also uses a separate MySQL database to store players and their number of betting chips. 

Code specific to the bot can be found in 'function_modules' and the bot.js file, this code (bar a few calls to node_modules snippets) is my own work.
The 'node_modules' folder includes opensource code used to facilitate the bot's function, this was not personally created by myself, relevant licenses should be included.
